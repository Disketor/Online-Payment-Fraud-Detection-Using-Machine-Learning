## Problem Statement

With the growth of e-commerce websites, people and financial companies rely on online services to carry out their transactions that have led to an exponential increase in the credit card frauds. Fraudulent credit card transactions lead to a loss of huge amount of money. The design of an effective fraud detection system is necessary in order to reduce the losses incurred by the customers and financial companies.

Therefore, in this project we develop a Streamlit App that utilizes a Machine Learning model(XGBoost) as an API to detect potential fraud in credit card transactions, based on the following criteria: Type of transaction, Amount(money), Old balance orig, New balance orig, Old balance dest, New balance dest.
